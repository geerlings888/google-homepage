This is my first website outside of a sandbox environment like freecodecademy. The website is supposed to represent some of the basic skills used in HTML and CSS. The skills exhibited in CSS are changing/tweaking colors, the padding and margin of elements and using grids to orient things on the page. Within HTML the skills being exhibited are including elements with outside sources organizing elements within different sections within the page (nav-bar, body, and footbar) and using inputs like buttons and a searchbar.
